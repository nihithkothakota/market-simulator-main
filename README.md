The ‘market simulator‘ project involves merging software reviews with product metadata, then
formatting and transforming the data for training a language model. It configures and trains a pre-trained model
with LoRA for efficient fine-tuning, monitors memory usage, and performs inference. Finally, it saves the trained
model in multiple formats and archives it for download.
